Consult your investment adviser/broker to get latest market information about shares you intend to buy or sell.

          <div class="bg-success content" style="margin-bottom:3px;">
            <p>
              The Central Depository Bangladesh Limited (CDBL) is a company set up by  the banks,  stock exchanges and other institutions to operate the central securities depository in Bangladesh. 
            </p>
          </div>

          <button type="button" class="collapsible  mbadd" >What is a depository? <span class="float-end dropdown-toggle "></span></button>
          <div class="bg-success content" style="margin-bottom:3px;">
            <p>
              A depository is like a bank for shares instead of money. Instead of holding shares in the form of certificates, investors have accounts in the depository and are able to move securities and settle stock exchange transactions by an electronic update of their accounts. Virtually all established markets have depositories including India, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, UK and USA. The core service of a depository is the efficient delivery, settlement and transfer of securities through a computerised book entry system. The Central Depository Bangladesh Limited (CDBL) is a company set up by  the banks,  stock exchanges and other institutions to operate the central securities depository in Bangladesh.
            </p>
          </div>

          <button type="button" class="collapsible  mbadd" >How do I open an account? <span class="float-end dropdown-toggle "></span></button>
          <div class="bg-success content" style="margin-bottom:3px;">
            <p>
              Investors may open an account with any CDBL participant (for an up to date list of participants, see Listed Participants).
              The participant will request the investor to sign an agreement which will set out the rights and duties of both the investor and the participant. The participant will then open an account for the investor at CDBL. Normally the account will be in the name of the investor. If the participant is going to mix one investors securities with another in an omnibus account then this must be specifically stated on the agreement. Where the account is in the name of the investor then the Law provides that the account holder is a member of the company even though his securities are dematerialised. The participant is required (under the regulations) to provide statements on at least a monthly basis if there are movements on the account. Even if there are no movements, the participant must provide a quarterly statement.Please refer to the Forms Download Page for a list of forms related to account opening.
            </p>
          </div>

          <button type="button" class="collapsible  mbadd" >Does CDBL affect buying & selling?<span class="float-end dropdown-toggle "></span></button>
          <div class="bg-success content" style="margin-bottom:3px;">
            <p>
              The introduction of CDBL does not make any difference to the process of buying and selling although it does make a difference to the settlement of such trades.
              Where investors have a CDBL account through their broker then the act of giving a sell order to the broker also authorises him to move securities from the account to settle the sale. The broker will move the securities when he enters the order into the market. If the order is executed then the securities are used to settle the sale. If the order is not executed then the broker will move the securities back to the investor's account.
              Where investors have a CDBL account through a custodian (who is not a broker) then they must advise their custodian that they have sold as they do for physical securities. However, the securities must be in a CDBL account before they are sold and the broker may wish to check this fact with the custodian before executing the order.
              On the settlement date of a bought trade the broker will move securities to the account of the buying investor (provided the investor has paid). Investors may leave the securities in their account (ready for when they wish to sell or to avoid the need to hold certificates) or they may request the participant to rematerialise the securities. Please refer to the Forms Download Page for a list of forms related to buying and selling.
            </p>

          <button type="button" class="collapsible  mbadd" >Will all shareholders need to have CDBL accounts?<span class="float-end dropdown-toggle "></span></button>
          <div class="bg-success content" style="margin-bottom:3px;">
            <p>
              A shareholder who does not trade will not be forced to have a CDBL account. However, the use of a CDBL account (either Direct or through a Participant) would remove the need to keep paper share certificates in a safe place. Quarterly statements would ensure that these investors always have an up to date record of their investments.
